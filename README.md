The Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnostics) dataset (WBC) of the UCI Machine Learning Repository is a classification dataset that records measurements of breast cancer cases. There are two classes, benign and malignant.

Attribute Information:

ID number Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 3-32) 
The features are computed for each cell nucleus: • diagnosis • radius_mean • texture_mean • perimeter_mean • area_mean • smoothness_mean • compactness_mean • concavity_mean • concave points_mean • symmetry_mean • fractal_dimension_mean • radius_se, texture_se • perimeter_se • area_se • smoothness_se • compactness_se • concavity_se • concave points_se • symmetry_se • fractal_dimension_se • radius_worst • texture_worst • perimeter_worst • area_worst • smoothness_worst • compactness_worst • concavity_worst • concave points_worst • symmetry_worst • fractal_dimension_worst

This project explains model building and training of the data, predicting the test data, and classification metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix using Logistic regression and Decision Tree algorithms.
